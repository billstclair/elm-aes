## Tests

This directory contains a simple test suite for the `AES` module. To run it, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). To install `elm-test`:

```
npm install -g elm-test
```

To run the tests:

```
cd .../elm-aes    # NOT the tests sub-directory
elm-test
```

To see results of individual tests:

```
elm-test --report json
```
